# Git Instructions

If you encounter an error message indicating that Git is unable to read credentials (username and password) you can resolve this issue by using a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your GitHub password for authentication. 
Follow these steps:

## 1. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub and sign in to your account.
   - At the top-right corner of the page, click on your profile picture and select "Settings".
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Developer settings", then on "Personal access tokens".
   - Click on "Generate new token".
   - Enter a description for the token (e.g., "Git push from command line").
   - Select the necessary permissions for the token. For push via HTTPS, you should at least select repository ("repo") permissions.
   - Click on "Generate token".
   - Copy the generated token. Make sure to copy it completely as it won't be visible once you leave the page.

## 2. Configure Git with the Personal Access Token:
   - In the terminal, run the following command:
     ```
     git config --global credential.helper store
     ```
   - This command will make Git store the credentials permanently in a file on your system.
   - Next, run any Git command that requires authentication (such as push). You will be prompted to enter credentials. Enter your GitHub username and, instead of the password, paste the Personal Access Token you generated.

After configuring Git with the Personal Access Token, you should be able to push to the remote repository without authentication issues.

## 3. Adding Files and Pushing to a New Branch:
   - First, create a new branch using the following command:
     ```
     git checkout -b new-branch-name
     ```
     Replace `new-branch-name` with the desired name for your new branch.
   - Add your files to the staging area using:
     ```
     git add .
     ```
     This command adds all files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
   - Commit your changes using:
     ```
     git commit -m "Your commit message here"
     ```
   - Finally, push your changes to the remote repository and the new branch using:
     ```
     git push origin new-branch-name
     ```
     Replace `new-branch-name` with the name of your new branch.
